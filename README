Title: WordJumble

Description: This program takes an input string (jumbled word) and unjumbles it by finding all of the possible words that could stem from it. For example, dog -> dog, god, do, go. 

Implementation: This program has time complexity of O(n) and space complexity of O(n). 

The time complexity stems from the fact that the program traverses through all elements in the iSpell word list 1 time. Specifically, it checks each element for certain characteristics that would indicate it being an "unjumbled" element; whether it has the same characters (at <= frequency) as the word to be unjumbled. 

The space complexity comes from the fact that the iSpell word list is stored in a Python list; this takes n space.

To Run:
navigate to folder "WordJumble"
